- 👋 Hi, I’m @dalb1 or David Albarran! 
- 👀 I’m interested in developing webpages for small businesses, seniors and education. I beleive it is essential to the local economy that small business thrive and having a 
well design website can really impact their business goals and needs for their customers. The idea of creating softwares/ websites for seniors interests me 
because many are left in retirement with not much to do and having a website that is designed for them can really benefit their day to day life. I also beleive in  creating websites for students is important for learners of all ages. Therefore, im interested in creating well desgined websites for all students to enhance their learning experience.

🌱 I’m currently improving my frontend development skills in HTML,CSS and JavaScript programming. Im currently at the stage where I am learning backend development with relation databases. Relational databases that I have worked with are Microsft access and SQL. I've developed the database architure, layout, and distingueshed datatypes for information being stored to elimnate any redundecies. I have some knowedgle of python programming, C programming and R, but I need more practice. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing new projects that will benefit users.
